# HELP:
# if the file ~/.xinitrc-used-by-personal-script not exits,you can copy the file
# /etc/skel/.xinitrc to your home directory and name it as .xinitrc-used-by-personal-script,
# and important:add the below two lines at the begining of this file:

#xrandr --setprovideroutputsource modesetting NVIDIA-0
#xrandr --auto

# then use zoey-startxfce4 again to see if you can get xorg work correctly.
# if it still not work ,that means your nvidia cards' driver may have some
# problems to work,check your nvidia drivers.
